## PWP Milestone 1 Feedback
Great work - your Purpose, Audience, Goal and Persona are thoughtful and detailed. Reading between the lines here, I get the impression that you know what sort of opportunities you're in the market for. I'm looking forward to seeing your content strategy and UI design concepts to come in Milestone 2a.

Your project and files are all set up to spec and your code looks great - nice work. Your Milestone 1 passes at <a href="https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/">Tier IV</a>. You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2Î±.
