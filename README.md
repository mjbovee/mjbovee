## PWP Milestone 1 Feedback
Great work - your Purpose, Audience, Goal and Persona are thoughtful and detailed. Reading between the lines here, I get the impression that you know what sort of opportunities you're in the market for. I'm looking forward to seeing your content strategy and UI design concepts to come in Milestone 2a.

Your project and files are all set up to spec and your code looks great - nice work. Your Milestone 1 passes at <a href="https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/">Tier IV</a>. You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2Î±.

## Milestone 2a Feedback
Awesome job on your Milestone 2a! You clearly thought through all aspects of your site design and interactivity. Your wireframes are very thorough and I like the intuitive menu at the top. Your content strategy especially is really well done and connects perfectly to the persona from Milestone 1. I look forward to seeing your site!

Your Milestone 2a passes at a Tier IV. Great job!
