		<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
		<p>I plan on making a one-page site that incorporates fairly minimal design. It will consist of four sections. I plan on using smooth CSS scroll behavior throughout the page. I'm considering the possibly of using CSS parallax, as well. I'd like to have a slightly opaque sticky navbar that contains a simple logo and that lists the sections of my page. This list will collapse into a hamburger menu when viewed on mobile. When selected, the hamburger menu will display its contents above the navbar.</p>
		<p><strong>Home: </strong>This will be the main landing "page" for site visitors. I'd like to use minimal JS that transforms my text when the page loads. The text will consist of my name and a very brief, top-level description of who I am and what I do. It'll be set upon on an image (probably a landscape photo of somewhere in New Mexico) with a color gradient overlay</p>
		<p><strong>Projects: </strong>I'd like this section to showcase 3-4 of the projects I've worked on over the past couple months. This page will consist of a series of images - one for each project I select - that will scale very subtly when they are hovered over. The images will link to a deployment of their associated project. The background of this section will be a solid neutral color (likely white) or a subtle gradient.</p>
		<p><strong>About: </strong>This section will include a couple small paragraphs that will provide summaries of my experience, my skills, my interests, and the programming languages/tools with which I feel proficient. This section's background will be another image (very similar to that on the home section) with a color gradient overlay. I don't intend on including any JS or animations in this section.</p>
		<p><strong>Contact: </strong>The primary focus of this section is a basic contact form. I'll also include a brief paragraph saying something to the effect of "let's get in touch." On desktop, these components will display side by side; on mobile, they will be aligned vertically in the center of the page. At the bottom of this section, I'll have links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and Medium pages.</p>
		<p><strong>Footer: </strong>Not really a section in and of itself, but I'd like to include a footer that contains a copyright and a sentence describing the tools and typefaces I used to build the site.</p>
