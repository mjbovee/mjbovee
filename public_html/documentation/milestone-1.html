			<h2>Purpose, Audience, and Goal</h2>
			<p><strong>Purpose: </strong>I intend this site to serve as a professional portfolio that showcases the webdev skills I'll have developed throughout the course of this bootcamp.</p>
			<p><strong>Audience: </strong>As a professional portfolio, the intended audience of this page will be professionals currently active within the information technology community. More specifically, I'd like to target potential employers - ideally employers based here in Albuquerque - who are actively seeking entry-level fullstack developers.</p>
			<p><strong>Goal: </strong>First and foremost, the goal behind developing this site is to connect with individuals (start-up founders, recruiters, etc.) that would be interested in providing me with employment or internship opportunities. An additional (but highly interrelated) goal is to create a designated space online in which I can make samples of my work visible to the public.</p>
