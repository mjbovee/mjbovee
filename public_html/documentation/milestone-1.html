			<h2>Purpose, Audience, and Goal</h2>
			<p><strong>Purpose: </strong>I intend this site to serve as a professional portfolio that showcases the webdev skills I'll have developed throughout the course of this bootcamp.</p>
			<p><strong>Audience: </strong>As a professional portfolio, the intended audience of this page will be professionals currently active within the information technology community. More specifically, I'd like to target potential employers - ideally employers based here in Albuquerque - who are actively seeking entry-level fullstack developers.</p>
			<p><strong>Goal: </strong>First and foremost, the goal behind developing this site is to connect with individuals (start-up founders, recruiters, etc.) that would be interested in providing me with employment or internship opportunities. An additional (but related) goal is to create a designated space online in which I can make samples of my work visible to the public.</p>

			<h2>Persona</h2>
			<img src="personaImage.jpeg" alt="Image of Mark Harris"/>
			<p><strong>Name:</strong>Mark Harris</p>
			<p><strong>Age:</strong>41</p>
			<p><strong>Occupation: </strong>Co-founder and co-owner of CactusWeb, a small Albuquerque-based firm focused on SEO optimization, branding, and web design and development.</p>
			<p><strong>Technology: </strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Desktop: Dell XPS 8930, Intel i7-8700 6-core processor, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD, CentOS</li>
					<li>Laptop: Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon 6th Gen 14" LCD Ultrabook, Intel Core i5-8250U 4-core processor, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD, CentOS </li>
					<li>Mobile: Samsung Galaxy S9+, 10nm 64-bit Octa-Core processor, 4GB RAM, 64GB, Android 8.0 OS</li>
				</ul>
			<p><strong>Attitudes and behaviors: </strong> Aside from the ~65 hours per week Mark has been putting in at CactusWeb, he is well integrated into the Albuquerque tech community and frequently attends local networking events. He's very selective about who he'll bring in for an interview, but is prone to hiring developers he's met in person. He's also been known to value recommendations from trusted colleagues and peers.</p>
			<p><strong>Frustrations and needs: </strong>CactusWeb is expanding rapidly and is need of new developers who are comfortable working across the stack. That said, they are still a relatively new company and cannot afford to pay a very high salary or provide comprehensive benefits at this time, though they do offer stock options. In addition, Mark is extremely busy and doesn't have time to conduct a lot of interviews. Though Mark would prefer hiring a developer who has a few years of experience, he's had some trouble drawing in experienced applicants and would be open to hiring a less-experienced developer insofar as they could demonstrate an aptitude for coding and high-level problem solving.</p>
			<p><strong>Goals: </strong>Mark would like to hire a proficient and self-directed developer as soon as possible. Given his packed schedule and the pressing need for a qualified canditate, Mark is only going to ask applicants with well-developed web pages to come in for interviews.</p>
			<p><strong>User story: </strong>Mark is reviewing the websites of developers who submitted applications to his most recent job posting. He hopes to find at least a few viable candidates to bring in for interviews.</p>
